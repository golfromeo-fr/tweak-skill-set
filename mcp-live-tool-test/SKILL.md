name: mcp-live-tool-test
description: Live-test the MCP tool servers by having the agent itself call every exposed function through its native mcp__<server>__<function> tools — the same path a real harness client uses. Use whenever the user asks to "test the MCP tools", "do tool calls", verify tools after a launcher restart or upgrade, check that servers/functions work, or says "are the tools up". The agent must make the calls itself, as many functions as possible — not one lazy call per server, and not a Python script doing the calls.

# Live MCP tool testing (agent-driven)

The agent makes real MCP tool calls through its native `mcp__<server>__<function>`
tools. That exercises the full client path (harness MCP client → auth → session →
server → tool), which is the thing the user actually wants validated. Scripts and
raw HTTP are only for checks a native call cannot express (see "Complementary
HTTP checks") — never a substitute for native calls.

Scope note: written for the `supreme-mcp-tools` workspace — repo paths below
(`tools/<name>/config.json`, `config/ports.json`, …) are relative to its root.
The native-call procedure itself is generic.

## Procedure

1. **Enumerate what is exposed.** Scan the session's available tools for
   `mcp__<server>__*`. Cross-check the expected function set against the repo:
   `tools/<name>/config.json` → `"tools"` section lists each tool's name and
   input schema. A server may be running but not wired into this session —
   say so explicitly if a configured server has no native tools.

2. **Call every function** — the user's expectation is a full sweep, not one
   call per server. Safe argument choices:
   - deterministic math/string tools → assert the exact expected value
     (`double(21)` must return 42)
   - fetch/search tools → cheap, harmless targets (`https://example.com`,
     query "smoke test")
   - exercise optional parameters on at least one call (e.g. a `greeting`
     override, a pagination `start_index`) — optional paths break too
   - **skip** mutation-sounding functions (`delete*`, `upsert*`, `create*`,
     `execute*`, `write*`, …) unless the user explicitly asks for them

3. **Verify each result**: a response came back, no error flag, plausible
   content. For deterministic tools, compare the exact value.

4. **Report a table**: function | arguments used | result | PASS/FAIL/SKIP,
   then a one-line summary (X passed / Y failed / Z skipped). Flag anything
   that is an upstream error rather than a server defect.

## Known failure mode: `Session not found` (code -32600)

The harness client holds a **stale `Mcp-Session-Id`** — typically after a
launcher restart or someone calling `POST /admin/flush-sessions` (it terminates
ALL live sessions, including the harness's own). The server answers 404 +
`{"error":{"code":-32600,"message":"Session not found"}}` and ZCode does not
auto-reinitialize mid-turn (see repo root `zcode-mcp-session-churn-bug.md`:
ZCode reconnects at task boundaries, ~4 parallel initializers per server).

Recovery — the CLIENT must re-initialize, nothing server-side fixes it:
1. Usually the **next user turn** (task boundary) re-establishes sessions.
2. Otherwise the user restarts the ZCode session / reconnects MCP servers.
3. Do not retry-loop the same call. Report the cause, ask for a new turn or
   reconnect, then verify recovery with one cheap deterministic call first
   (e.g. `square`) before resuming the sweep.

When testing flush-sessions recovery deliberately: do it LAST, after all
native sweeps are done, and warn that it kills the harness's own sessions.

## Expected arguments (supreme-mcp-tools)

| Function | Safe args | Deterministic? |
|---|---|---|
| `mcp__simplemcp__double` | `{"value": 21}` | yes → 42 |
| `mcp__simplemcp__square` | `{"value": 7}` | yes → 49 |
| `mcp__simplemcp__greet` | `{"name": "smoke", "greeting": "Howdy"}` | yes → "Howdy, smoke!" |
| `mcp__simplemcp__get_secret` | `{}` | returns the SIMPLEMCP_SECRET fixture |
| webmcp `brave_search_web` / `brave_search_api` | `{"query": "...", "count": 3}` | 429 = upstream rate limit, not a defect |
| webmcp `google_search_api` | `{"query": "..."}` | no |
| webmcp `post_url` | `https://httpbin.org/post` + small JSON body | echoed payload |
| webmcp `fetch_url` | `{"url": "https://example.com"}` | no |

For functions not listed: read the input schema from the session's tool
definition or the tool's `config.json`, pick minimal safe args, and skip with
a note if none are safe.

## Complementary HTTP checks (only when explicitly wanted)

Native calls cannot express these; use a short inline `python` + `httpx`
snippet (repo has httpx):

- **Auth enforced**: POST `/mcp` `initialize` without auth header → expect
  HTTP 401. A 200 here is an auth hole — report immediately.
- **Flush recovery**: initialize (get session id) → `POST /admin/flush-sessions`
  with `X-API-Key` → old session id must now get HTTP 404 → fresh initialize
  yields a new id. Remember: this terminates all live sessions of that tool.

Ports come from `config/ports.json` (`assignments.mcp`), keys from
`tools/<name>/config.json` (`auth.api_key`).
